# WEEK02 - bmi.py - BMI Calculator
# Regarding inputs, I had to research to use FLOAT rather than INT when inputting height, as height is calculated in meters and to use a decimal you must use FLOAT
# (int only works with whole numbers)
# Regarding the print of result, I had to research how I could print both a text result and also the output of the calculation.
# This was done using {}.format which was covered in lecture videos
# Reference URL's pasted within bmi.py
